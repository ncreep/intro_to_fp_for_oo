# Introduction to <br /> Functional Programming for  <br /> OO Programmers

.leftFloat[]
.rightFloat[Daniel Beskin]
---

## Introduction

- Goal: Introduce Functional Programming to OO developers.

- The full code can be found at:  
https://github.com/ncreep/intro_to_fp_for_oo
???

- This is going to be an introduction to some not so basic Functional programming concepts, from the point of view of an OO programmer.

- I'll be assuming that you are comfortable with the more basic concepts like recursion and higher order functions.

- If not, we have a quick warm up ahead of us, so I hope you do get up to speed.

Functional programming combines the flexibility and power of abstract mathematics with the intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics.
---


## Why? What? How?

- Why?
  * Composability
  * Powerful abstractions
  * Concurrency
  * Scalability
  * Elegance
  * Mathematical inclination
  * ...

- What?
  * Putting the usage of (pure) functions to the forefront
  
- How?
  * Compare FP solutions to existing OO design patterns
  
???

- I'm guessing that if you came to this meetup, you probably have a reason to be interested in FP.
- So I won't spend much time convincing you about it.
- Pick any one of the reasons here, or others, and just hold on to it during the lecture.
- A natural question in this context is: what is Functional programming?
- Just as with Object Orientation, there is no real consensus on what that is.
- For our purposes, it's just going to be a programming style that puts the usage of (pure) functions to the forefront.
- Not a very useful definition, but that will have to do.
- To make the whole thing closer to the OO world, we are going to pick several well-known OO design patterns and try to reimplement
them using Functional style.
- As a caveat, note that in Scala, being a hybrid OO/FP language, in some cases it might be actually  more appropriate to use a non-FP approach.
- But we are going to ignore this for the purposes of this lecture.

## Warm-up: Iterator

---

An OO iterator

``` 
case class Bug(c: Code)
case class Feature(c: Code)

val bugs: List[Bug] = List(Bug("null"), Bug("???"), Bug("var x = 3"))

val bugsIter = bugs.iterator
val featureBuffer = ListBuffer[Feature]()

while(bugsIter.hasNext) {
  featureBuffer += Feature(bugsIter.next().c)
}

val features = featureBuffer.toList

// => List(Feature(null), Feature(???), Feature(var x = 3))
```

---

An FP (internal) iterator

``` 
val features: List[Feature] = bugs map (b => Feature(b.c))

val features2: List[Feature] = for (b <- bugs) yield Feature(b.c)

// => List(Feature(null), Feature(???), Feature(var x = 3))
```

---

Iteration combinators

```
case class Programmer(assignedBugs: List[Bug])

val p1 = Programmer(List(Bug("null"), Bug("???"), Bug("var x = 3")))
val p2 = Programmer(List(Bug("foo.asInstanceOf[Bar]"), Bug("1 = 2")))
val ps = List(p1, p2)
  
val allFeatures: List[Feature] = 
  ps flatMap (p => p.assignedBugs map (b => Feature(b.c)))

val allFeatures2: List[Feature] = 
  for {
    p <- ps
    b <- p.assignedBugs
  } yield Feature(b.c)

// List(Feature(null), Feature(???), Feature(var x = 3), 
//      Feature(foo.asInstanceOf[Bar]), Feature(1 = 2))
```
  
---

layout: true

## Warm-up: Null Object

---
Dealing with missing values

```
val compiledCode = {
  val coffee = getCoffee()
  if (coffee == null) null
  else {
    val code = coffee.writeCode()
    if (code == null) null
    else code.tryCompile()
  }
}
```

???

```
val compiledCode = {
  val coffee = getCoffee()
  if (coffee == null) null
  else {
    val code = coffee.writeCode()
    if (code == null) null
    else code.tryCompile()
  }
}

// either 'null' or 'Compiled(3 coffee => code)'

def getCoffee(): Coffee = choose(Coffee(3), null)

// choose a random item from the two
def choose[A](x: A, y: A): A = if (util.Random.nextDouble() < 0.5) x else y

case class Coffee(amount: Int) {
  def writeCode(): Code = choose(Code(s"$amount coffee => code"), null)
}

case class Code(code: String) {
  def tryCompile(): Compiled = choose(Compiled(code), null)
}

case class Compiled(code: String)
```

---

Using Null Objects

```
val compiledCode = getCoffee().writeCode().tryCompile()

// either 'NotCompiled' or 'RealCompiled(3 coffee => code)'
```

--

The boilerplate
```
trait Coffee { def writeCode(): Code }
case class RealCoffee(amount: Int) extends Coffee {
  def writeCode(): Code = choose(RealCode(s"$amount coffee => code"), NoCode)
}
case object NoCoffee extends Coffee { def writeCode(): Code = NoCode }

trait Code { def tryCompile(): Compiled }
case class RealCode(code: String) extends Code {
  def tryCompile(): Compiled = choose(RealCompiled(code), NotCompiled)
}
case object NoCode extends Code { def tryCompile(): Compiled = NotCompiled }

trait Compiled
case class RealCompiled(code: String) extends Compiled
case object NotCompiled extends Compiled

def getCoffee(): Coffee = choose(RealCoffee(3), NoCoffee)
```

???

Null objects are safer, but require way too much boilerplate for every case. In return:

- we don't get any help from the compiler
- there is no generic way to compose different null objects

Let's look at the FP alternative, `Option`.

---


The FP alternative

```
val compiledCode: Option[Compiled] = 
  getCoffee() flatMap { coffee =>
    coffee.writeCode() flatMap { code =>
      code.tryCompile()
    }
  }
      
// either 'None' or 'Some(Compiled(3 coffee => code))'
```

???

The `flatMap`s let us dig into the optional values and manipulate their contents.

--

```
def getCoffee(): Option[Coffee] = choose(Some(Coffee(3)), None)

case class Coffee(amount: Int) {
  def writeCode(): Option[Code] = 
    choose(Some(Code(s"$amount coffee => code")), None)
}

case class Code(code: String) {
  def tryCompile(): Option[Compiled] = 
    choose(Some(Compiled(code)), None)
}

case class Compiled(code: String)
```



---

Using `for` notation

```
val compiledCode: Option[Compiled] = 
  for {
    coffee <- getCoffee
    code <- coffee.writeCode()
    compiled <- code.tryCompile()
  } yield compiled
      
```

???

`Option` is like a list of 0 or 1 items, we can use the `for` notation from before.

Now that we're all warmed up, we can move on to something more challenging

##  Decorator Pattern

---

???

- The decorator pattern is used to create different combinations of object behaviors.

- Probably the most Scala-esque way to achieve this is the [stackable trait pattern](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/stackable_trait_pattern.html).

- But we'll stick to the more conventional version of the pattern.

---

A model of a programmer

```
trait Programmer {
  def price: Money
  def makeCode(coffee: Coffee): LOC
  def acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean
}
```




---

An implementation

```
class BasicProgrammer(experience: XPPoints,
                      coffeeConsumption: Coffee,
                      languages: Set[Language]) extends Programmer {
                      
  def price: Money = experience * languages.size

  /* more coffee -> more code */
  def makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC =
    experience * math.max(0, c - coffeeConsumption)

  def acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean = languages(l)
}
```

```
abstract class ProgrammerDecorator(p: Programmer) extends Programmer {
  def price: Money = p.price
  def makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC = p.makeCode(c)
  def acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean = p.acceptProject(l)
}
```

???

We need a default decorator that forwards all method calls to another `Programmer`

---

Concrete decorators

```
/* a programmer that writes tests */
class TestingProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def price: Money = super.price * 2
  override def makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC = super.makeCode(c - 5) * 3
}

/* a programmer that writes documentation */
class DocumentingProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def price: Money = super.price * 10
}

class SaneProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def acceptProject(l): Boolean =
    if (l == "PHP") false
    else super.acceptProject(l)
}

/* a programmer that likes learning new languages */
class PolyglotProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
  override def acceptProject(l): Boolean = !super.acceptProject(l)
}
```

---

Using decorators

```
val base = new BasicProgrammer(
  experience = 10, 
  coffeeConsumption = 30, 
  languages = Set("Scala", "Java", "PHP"))

val saneDocTest = 
  new SaneProgrammer(new DocumentingProgrammer(new TestingProgrammer(base)))
  
val documentingPolyglot = new PolyglotProgrammer(new DocumentingProgrammer(base))

base.price // 30
base.makeCode(40) // 100
base.acceptProject("PHP") // true

saneDocTest.price // 600
saneDocTest.makeCode(40) // 150
saneDocTest.acceptProject("PHP") // false

documentingPolyglot.price // 300
documentingPolyglot.makeCode(40) // 100
documentingPolyglot.acceptProject("PHP") // false
```

???

We can create different `Programmer`s by combining the different decorators

---

Converting from OO to FP
<table class="codeTable">
<tr><td>`prog.price()`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`price(prog)`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.makeCode(coffee)`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`makeCode(prog, coffee)`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.acceptProject(lang)`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`acceptProject(prog, lang)`</td></tr>
</table>

???

- Now, let's look at this problem from a Functional perspective.

- We need to rephrase the problem in terms of functions that are separate from the data they operate on.

- Because of the implicit `this`, we can view method calls as functions

--

With types
<table class="codeTable">
<tr><td>`prog.price(): Money`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`Programmer => Money`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.makeCode(c: Coffee): LOC`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`Programmer => (Coffee => LOC)`</td></tr>
<tr><td>`prog.acceptProject(l: Language): Boolean`</td><td>&nbsp;`-->`&nbsp;</td><td>`Programmer => (Language => Boolean)`</td></tr>
</table>

---

Chaining
.codeTable[
`TestingProgrammer(DocumentingProgrammer(prog)).price()`  
`-->`  
`testPrice(docPrice(price(prog)))`
]

--

With types
.codeTable[
`TestingProgrammer(DocumentingProgrammer(prog)).price()`  
`-->`  
`(Programmer => Money) andThen (Money => Money) andThen (Money => Money)`  
]  
```
(f andThen g)(x) == g(f(x))
```

???

- Viewed this way, the call to `super` is like function chaining

- So decoration is (almost) function composition

- Let's code it up

---
FP `Programmer`

```
case class Programmer(experience: XPPoints,
                      coffeeConsumption: Coffee,
                      languages: Set[Language])
```

```
val price: Programmer => Money =
  p => p.experience * p.languages.size

val makeCode: Programmer => (Coffee => LOC) =
  p => c => p.experience * math.max(0, c - p.coffeeConsumption)

val acceptProject: Programmer => (Language => Boolean) =
  p => l => p.languages(l)
```

---

Using it

```
val p = Programmer(
  experience = 10, 
  coffeeConsumption = 30, 
  languages = Set("Scala", "Java", "PHP"))

price(p) // 30
makeCode(p)(40) // 100
acceptProject(p)("PHP") // true
```

---

The decorators
```
val testPrice: Money => Money = 
  m => m * 2

val docPrice: Money => Money = 
  m => m * 10
  
val testMakeCode: (Coffee => LOC) => (Coffee => LOC) =
  mc =>
    c => mc(c - 5) * 3

val saneAccept: (Language => Boolean) => (Language => Boolean) =
  ap =>
    l => if (l == "PHP") false else ap(l)

val polyAccept: (Language => Boolean) => (Language => Boolean) =
  ap =>
    l => !ap(l)
```

---

Using it

```
val testDocPrice = price andThen testPrice andThen docPrice
val testMC = makeCode andThen testMakeCode
val saneAcc = acceptProject andThen saneAccept

val docPr = price andThen docPrice
val polyAcc = acceptProject andThen polyAccept

testDocPrice(p) // 600
testMC(p)(40) // 150
saneAcc(p)("PHP") // false

docPr(p) // 300
polyAcc(p)("PHP") // false
```

???

- We can now imitate the decorator combinations from before

- Notice that we only create the functions that were actually overriden by the OO decorators.
        
---

 Recap:

- Methods are just functions: `Programmer => A`

- Decorators are functions of type: `A => A`

- Decoration is (almost) function composition:  
`(Programmer => A) andThen (A => A)` `-->` `Programmer => A`

???

- But who said that we have to use the same `A` all over the place? Function composition works just as well with different types.

--

- Generified version:  
`(Programmer => A) andThen (A => B)` `-->` `Programmer => B`
        

  
???

- To achieve this in the OO version we would have to change the `Programmer` interface for every new function that we want to define.
---

Using a general decorator
```
val shouldHire: Money => Boolean = m => m < 50

val executiveDecision1: Programmer => Boolean = 
  price andThen shouldHire
  
val executiveDecision2: Programmer => Boolean = 
  price andThen testPrice andThen shouldHire

executiveDecision1(p) // true
executiveDecision2(p) // false
```  

???

- Using function composition we can take any function chain of the form:  
`Programmer => A => (A => B) => (B => C) => ... => (C => D)`  
and turn it into a single function `Programmer => D`
- This is a step beyond what we had in the classic decorator, but we are still missing something.
- Although we didn't use it explicitly, in the original decorator, we had access to the value we wrapped. In  
```
class DocumentingProgrammer(p: Programmer) extends ProgrammerDecorator(p) {
    override def price: Money = super.price * 10
  }
```
we could actually call whatever we want on `p`. But there's no mention of a `Programmer` down our functions chain.
- So how do we translate it back to our Functional code?

---

A new decorator type
```
Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B) --> Programmer => B
```

???

- It means that we need to have a `Programmer` available inside our decorators:
`Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B)`
- But the `Programmer` inside the chain should be the same one we started with:  
`Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B)` `-->` `Programmer => B`
- Let's call the function that does this `flatAndThen`

--

Follow the types
```
implicit class Decorator[A](f: Programmer => A) {
  def flatAndThen[B](g: A => Programmer => B): Programmer => B =
    p => {
      val a: A = f(p)
      val pToB: Programmer => B = g(a)
      val b: B = pToB(p)
      b
    }
}
```

???
- With this function we can take any chain of the form:  
`Programmer => A => (A => Programmer => B) => (B => Programmer => C) => ... => (C => Programmer => D)`  
and turn into a single function `Programmer => D`
- To write down the function we'll just try to "follow the types" (down the rabbit hole) and see where it gets us.
- We'll use an implicit class to "pimp" this function directly on our functions.
- Notice how the same `p` is used twice.

---

Using the new decorator
```
val bonus: Money => (Programmer => Money) =
  m => p => m + p.experience
  
val withBonus: Programmer => Money = 
  price andThen testPrice flatAndThen bonus

withBonus(p) // 70
```

--

```
// with enough coffee, even a dead programmer can produce code
val deadProgrammer: (Coffee => LOC) => Programmer => (Coffee => LOC) =
  mc => p =>
    c => if (c > 4 * p.coffeeConsumption) mc(c) else 0
    
val deadMake: Programmer => (Coffee => LOC) = 
  makeCode flatAndThen deadProgrammer andThen testMakeCode
  
deadMake(p)(50) // 0
deadMake(p)(130) // 2850
```

---

Combining `Programmer` functions

```
val costEffective: Programmer => Boolean =
  makeCode flatAndThen { mc =>
    price flatAndThen { pr =>
      (p: Programmer) => mc(p.coffeeConsumption) > pr
    }
  }
    
costEffective(p) // false
```

???

- We can also combine a number of `Programmer` functions.
- `makeCode` is like a container for a `Coffee => LOC` function value, and `price` is a container for a `Money` value.
- `andThen` and `flatAndThen` help us reach inside the container and manipulate its contents (sounds familiar?).
- The values depend on the `Programmer` instance that we are going to provide in the future.
- Kind of like Dependency Injection.
- But it's becoming a bit clumsy to write, we'll address this issue later on.
- OO decoration is similar to FP (flattened) function composition.
- OO decoration works well when we have a fixed set of functions and many types of data.
- FP decoration works well when we have a fixed set of data types and many functions to calculate over them.
- Because of how function composition works, when used in the right context, FP decoration is much more flexible and lightweight than the OO counterpart.

## Interpreter Pattern

---


???


- The interpreter pattern is used when your language does not provide you with the right level of abstraction for the task at hand.  
- So you create your own Domain-Specific Language and embed it in the host language.  
- Nothing particularly OO about this. Typically, you represent the language as a `Composite`, and you interpret it using a `Visitor`.  
- Both patterns are pretty much lifted from FP, so we'll skip the OO implementation this time.  
- Scala has a number of ways to create DSLs, e.g.: higher order functions, macros, string interpolators.  
- We'll try to come up with a way that works particularly well with separating the language from its interpretation.  


--
The domain:

- Drink coffee
- Write code
- Compile
- Commit code
- Bang head on keyboard

???

- We would like to interconnect the different actions, so that one leads to another.  
- We also want to have interaction with the outer world.   
- For example, compilation produces some response from outside, and based on this response we choose the next action.  
- But we do not want our language to know anything about how to obtain the responses, the interpreter will be responsible for that.  

---

The domain:

```
sealed trait ProgAction

A sample program

```
val prog: ProgAction = 
  DrinkCoffee(3,
    coffee => WriteCode(coffee,
      code => Compile(code,
        compileResponse => compileResponse match {
          case WaitTime(_) => CommitCode(code)
          case _ => BangHeadOnKeyboard
        })))
```

---

Combining smaller programs

```
val drinkWrite: ProgAction = 
  DrinkCoffee(3,
    coffee => WriteCode(coffee,
      code => ???
    ))

val compile: Code => ProgAction = 
  code => Compile(code, compileResponse => ???)
  
drinkWrite next compile
```

???

- But we have a problem, what if we want to write snippets of actions and combine them together.
- We don't have a `next` function.
- Nor do the types work out even if we did.
- And what do we put instead of the `???`?
- The first snippet worked because we ended with either `CommitCode` or `BangHeadOnKeyboard`, both of those do not require any further actions.
- But that's not the case with the other actions, we can't finish a snippet with any of those.
- Let's loosen up the types a little bit, and see whether we can make this work.

---

A generified domain
```
sealed trait ProgAction[+A]

case class DrinkCoffee[A](c: Cups, next: Coffee => A) extends ProgAction[A]
case class WriteCode[A](c: Coffee, next: Code => A) extends ProgAction[A]
case class Compile[A](c: Code, next: CompileResponse => A) extends ProgAction[A]
case class CommitCode(c: Code) extends ProgAction[Nothing]
case object BangHeadOnKeyboard extends ProgAction[Nothing]
```

???
- Now that the type is general, maybe we can use it to stub out arbitrary chains.

- For this purpose, we are going to introduce some glue.

--

```
sealed trait Program[+A]
case class Return[A](a: A) extends Program[A]
case class Glue[A](pa: ProgAction[Program[A]]) extends Program[A]
```

???

- A `Program` is just a wrapper around some value of type `A`.

- `Glue` sticks pieces of `ProgAction`s together, and `Return` lets us stub out a chain, returning the contained value.

---

Using `Program`
```
val drink: Program[Coffee] =
  Glue(
    DrinkCoffee(3,
      coffee => Return(coffee)))

val drinkWrite: Program[Code] =
  Glue(
    DrinkCoffee(1,
      coffee => Glue(
        WriteCode(coffee,
          code => Return(code)))))
```

???
- Each `Program` snippet contains the response for the action wrapped in a `Return`.

- Stubbing done, what about the `next` function?

---

Composing `Program`s

```
val drinkWrite: Program[Code]
val compile: Code => Program[CompileResponse]
val drinkWriteCompile: Program[CompileResponse] = drinkWrite next compile

def next[A, B]: Program[A] => (A => Program[B]) => Program[B]
```

???

- Using the language of `Program`, we have the following types:
- `next` should reach into our program, fetch the `A` value, apply a function to it, and produce a new `Program`.

--

`next` implementation

```
sealed trait Program[+A] {
  def next[B](f: A => Program[B]): Program[B] = this match {
    case Return(a) => f(a)
    case Glue(pa: ProgAction[Program[A]]) => ???
  }
}
```

???

- We code `next` as a method on `Program`. Start with the easy case, `Return`.
- If we see a `Return`, we unwrap it, apply the function and return its result.
- The `Glue` case is more difficult, because the `A` value is hidden inside a `ProgAction[Program[A]]`.
- We need some way to reach into the `ProgAction` and apply the function there.

---

Operating inside `ProgAction`
```
def map[A, B]: ProgAction[A] => (A => B) => ProgAction[B]
```

???

- We can generalize the type a little.
- Which reads as: reach into the `ProgAction`, apply the function there, and rewrap it back into a `ProgAction`.
- With these types, there is only one way to implement this function.

--

```
sealed trait ProgAction[+A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): ProgAction[B] = this match {
    case DrinkCoffee(c, next: (Coffee => A)) => DrinkCoffee(c, next andThen f)
    case WriteCode(c, next: (Code => A)) => WriteCode(c, next andThen f)
    case Compile(c, next: (CompileResponse => A)) => Compile(c, next andThen f)
    case CommitCode(c) => CommitCode(c)
    case BangHeadOnKeyboard => BangHeadOnKeyboard
  }
}
```

???

- We do it as a method on `ProgAction`:
- Any `ProgAction` that has a `next` function, just composes `f` after its own `next`.
- The final `ProgAction`s ignore it altogether.

---

`next` implementation

```
sealed trait Program[+A] {
  def next[B](f: A => Program[B]): Program[B] = this match {
    case Return(a) => f(a)
    case Glue(pa: ProgAction[Program[A]]) => {
      val progActionB: ProgAction[Program[B]] =
        pa map { (p: Program[A]) =>
          val pb: Program[B] = p next f
          pb
        }
      Glue(progActionB)
    }
  }
}
```

???
- Now that we can reach into our `ProgAction`s, we can complete the definition of `next`.
- In the `Glue` case we recursively apply `f` until we either hit a `Return` or a final `ProgAction`.


---

Composing `Program`s
```
val write: Program[Code] = 
  Glue(WriteCode(3, code => Return(code)))

val compile: Code => Program[CompileResponse] =
  code => Glue(Compile(code, compileResp => Return(compileResp)))
  
val writeCompile: Program[CompileResponse] = 
  write next compile
```


???

- Finally, we can compose our `ProgAction`s.
- It works! 
- Or at the very least it compiles, though that's most of what you need when you program by "following the types".
- But those references to `Glue`s are quite annoying, let's try to hide them away.

---

The `Program` primitives

```
def ret[A](a: A) = Return(a)

val drinkCoffee: Cups => Program[Coffee] = 
  cups => Glue(DrinkCoffee(cups, coffee => ret(coffee)))
  
val writeCode: Coffee => Program[Code] = 
  coffee => Glue(WriteCode(coffee, code => ret(code)))
  
val compile: Code => Program[CompileResponse] = 
  code => Glue(Compile(code, cr => ret(cr)))
  
val bangHeadOnKeyboard: Program[Nothing] = 
  Glue(BangHeadOnKeyboard)

val commitCode: Code => Program[Nothing] = 
  code => Glue(CommitCode(code))
```

???
- We can factor out the `Glue`s into a bunch of primitive functions, one for every action we have.
- There's a common pattern here, which can be factored into a separate function, I'll leave it as an exercise (you can see the solution in the repository). 

---

Examples

```
val writeCompile: Program[CompileResponse] = writeCode(3) next compile
```


???

- We can create any `Program` we want using our primitives.

- And we can now write more complicated descriptions of programmers.

- The ideal programmer just keeps writing code until it compiles and does not abuse coffee.

- The nervous programmer abuses coffee, without actually turning it into code...

- Now that we have a language, it would be a bit pointless if we don't do something with it. 

- Let's hack up an interpreter for it. 

- Our interpreter is just a pretty printer.

--

```
val idealProgrammer: Program[Code] =
  drinkCoffee(1) next writeCode next { code =>
    compile(code) next { response =>
      response match {
        case WaitTime(_) => ret(code)
        case Exception => idealProgrammer
        case ScaryTypeException => idealProgrammer
      }
    }
  }
```

--

```
val nervousProgrammer: Program[Code] =
  drinkCoffee(1) next writeCode next { code =>
    compile(code) next { response =>
      response match {
        case WaitTime(t) => drinkCoffee(3 * t) next (_ => ret(code))
        case Exception => drinkCoffee(2) next (_ => nervousProgrammer)
        case ScaryTypeException => bangHeadOnKeyboard
      }
    }
  }
```


---

A pretty printer

```
def print(p: Program[_]): Unit = p match {
  case Return(a) => println(a)
  case Glue(pa) => pa match {
    case DrinkCoffee(cups, next) =>
      println(s"Drink coffee: $cups")
      print(next(cups * 3))
    case WriteCode(cofee, next) =>
      println(s"Write with $cofee coffee")
      print(next(randomCode()))
    case Compile(code, next) =>
      println(s"Compile: '$code'")
      print(next(codeToResponse(code)))
    case CommitCode(code) => println(s"Commit: '$code'")
    case BangHeadOnKeyboard => println("Bang head on keyboard")
  }
}

def randomCode(): Code = Random.shuffle(codeToResponse.keys.toList).head

val codeToResponse = Map(
  "java code" -> WaitTime(1),
  "scala code" -> WaitTime(20),
  "implicits spaghetti" -> WaitTime(400),
  "null abuse" -> Exception,
  "higher kinded madness" -> ScaryTypeException)
```



---

Output 
```
print(idealProgrammer next commitCode)
```

```asciidoc
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'higher kinded madness'
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'java code'
Commit: 'java code'
```

```
print(nervousProgrammer next commitCode)
```

```asciidoc
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'null abuse'
Drink coffee: 2
Drink coffee: 1
Write with 3 coffee
Compile: 'higher kinded madness'
Bang head on keyboard
```

- In the same vein, we can write other kinds of interpreters.
- You can see couple of other examples in the repository. 
- One counts the amount of coffee the programmer consumes. 
- The other fetches the code that the programmer produced.
- We have managed to define a small language using composable parts.
- This sort of composability would be hard to achieve with OO techniques.
- But may be overkill for simpler languages.
- This technique is (way) more general than what we did here.

The heavy lifting is done, now let's step back to get some perspective

.toy_story[![](toy_story.jpg)]

???


- Remember how way back on one of the first slides we dissed design patterns?

- Let's drop the "design" and just look for patterns.

- Do we see any in the different FP examples thus far?

## Design Patterns - Redux

A common pattern

```
type ForProg[A] = Programmer => A

def flatMap[A, B]:     List[A]    => (A => List[B])    => List[B]
def flatMap[A, B]:     Option[A]  => (A => Option[B])  => Option[B]
def flatAndThen[A, B]: ForProg[A] => (A => ForProg[B]) => ForProg[B]
def next[A, B]:        Program[A] => (A => Program[B]) => Program[B]
```

--

```
def flatMap[A, B]: M[A] => (A => M[B]) => M[B]
```

Monads!

- `Programmer => A` is an instance of the Reader monad.

- `Program[A]` is an instance of the Free monad.

???

- Things like `M` actually have a name, which comes from abstract math, they are called Monads.

- With the Free monad you can do a whole lot more than just interpreters, but that's a whole topic in itself.

???

- So I won't be explaining monads in this lecture. 

- But I will give you some motivation on why you should care about them.

- Once you figure out that something is a monad, you can apply generic monad functions on it.

- A concrete example in Scala is the `for` syntax.

- The `for` syntax is provided for free for anything that can be regarded as a monad. 

- Specifically, anything that supports `flatMap` (and `map`).

- We can rewrite some of the code from before with `for` notation (the full code is in the repository).

---

Monadic `for`

```
val costEffective: Programmer => Boolean =
  for {
    mc <- makeCode
    pr <- price
    p <- getProgrammer
  } yield mc(p.coffeeConsumption) > pr
```

```
def nervousProgrammer: Program[Code] =
  for {
    code <- drinkCoffee(1) next writeCode
    response <- compile(code)
    finalCode <- response match {
      case WaitTime(t) => drinkCoffee(3 * t) next (_ => ret(code))
      case Exception => drinkCoffee(1) next (_ => nervousProgrammer)
      case ScaryTypeException => bangHeadOnKeyboard
    }
  } yield finalCode
```

???

- Monads are one of the many mathematical structures that are used in Functional programming.

- Different code patterns, become mathematical structures.

- These are the equivalents of design patterns in FP.

- Looking around for these patterns, can greatly improve the design of our code.
